       "{'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66816564': 'One of China\\'s most popular influencers has come under fire for dismissing a young follower\\'s complaint over high makeup prices as \"nonsense\".  Livestreamer Li Jiaqi\\'s retort - that those who couldn\\'t afford the 79 yuan ($11; Â£9) eyebrow pencil did not work \"hard enough\" - struck a raw nerve as China\\'s youth struggle to find jobs in a sputtering post-pandemic economy. The 31-year-old has apologised but his remarks continue to fuel debate.  \"What stung people was not the 79 yuan price tag, but your attitude and opinions on us,\" reads a comment on Weibo, which has been liked thousands of times.   \"You don\\'t know about the current economic climate. Many people are still working hard and struggling, just to keep their jobs,\" it read.    The past six months has brought a stream of bad news for China\\'s economy. Youth unemployment has hit a record high. As of July, more than one in five 16-to-24-year-olds were jobless. The following month, officials said they would temporarily stop publishing unemployment data.  The property sector, which until recently accounted for a third of China\\'s entire wealth, has long been teetering on the brink of a full-blown crisis. Economists have downgraded their forecasts for China\\'s economic growth, many to below the government\\'s target of about 5%.   Li - who first rose to fame in 2017 when he started hosting online sales sessions on shopping platform Taobao - is one of China\\'s most successful salesmen. He hawks a range of products from food to cosmetics and homeware, and reportedly sells millions of dollars\\' worth of items every night. He earned the moniker Lipstick King by once selling 150,000 lipsticks within five minutes. Over the years, Li has garnered some 150 million followers across multiple platforms -  that number has shrunk since his controversial comments.   Given the bleak prospects millions of young Chinese face, Li\\'s comments are proof that his celebrity status has desensitised him to their struggles, critics said. But the anger has also provided a window to the disillusionment rampant among the country\\'s youth - one tweet read: \"In social media comments responding to the Li Jiaqi incident, I saw a China that\\'s collapsing.\"   The controversy began on Sunday when Li was livestreaming a sales pitch for an eyebrow pencil from Chinese cosmetic brand Florasis.  In response to a viewer who commented that the eyebrow pencil was too expensive, Li said: \"How is that expensive? This has been the price for so many years. Stop spouting nonsense,\" he said, adding that domestic companies have been struggling.  He went on to tell the viewer off, \"Sometimes you have to look inward, reflect on why you haven\\'t received a pay raise after so many years. Have you been working hard enough?\"   \"It\\'s been the same price all these years! This is driving me crazy,\" he concluded in an outburst, which also shocked his co-host, according to a widely-circulated clip of the exchange.  Criticism erupted online shortly after the livestream, soon spurring a series of hashtags on Weibo. A large proportion of Li\\'s millions-strong following is young Chinese women who have also been hit hard by the slowdown.  Many users posted about how they have been struggling to make ends meet and how their wages have not been proportional to the effort they put in at work.  \"No pay increase is not because we don\\'t work hard. I have not had a pay raise for three years, and the prices for everything have been surging high... These days I only buy daily necessities, I no longer participate in the big sales,\" another user wrote.  State media also weighed in, with CCTV criticising Li. \"Many Internet celebrities and anchors were humble before making money, and became very inflated after making money... and are doomed to be disgusting,\" it said in a commentary on its website.  Li is no stranger to controversy. In June last year, he displayed a tank-shaped ice cream cake on his show just hours before the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.   Decades on, all references to the Tiananmen protests or what followed remains a censored topic in China. Li\\'s broadcast of the tank-shaped cake was abruptly cut and he disappeared for three months, before reappearing on screen in September last year.   Following this week\\'s uproar, Li issued a written apology on Monday morning, acknowledging his \"inappropriate remarks\". He wrote: \"I am well aware that everyone\\'s work is tough... I\\'m really sorry that what I said failed you all.\"   He addressed the issue again later that day via livestream, where he said that it was \"not [his] place to judge\" anyone on the Internet.  Still, the furore did not subside. Li\\'s comments continued going viral on Tuesday, with many people calling for a boycott of his livestream channel. A Weibo user with the handle Baixiwen said they \"do not expect Li to be empathetic to our situation\".  \"Many of us work just as hard as [Li] does. We are just not lucky enough to achieve his level of success. For many people, being broke is not a choice,\" wrote another Weibo user.   Is China\\'s economy a \\'ticking time bomb\\'?

       " 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66852291': 'Diplomatic tensions over calls for a separate homeland for Sikhs in India have escalated, after Canada said it was looking at \"credible allegations potentially linking\" the Indian state to the murder of a separatist leader in British Columbia.  India has denied the allegations, describing them as \"absurd\".  For anyone new to this long-running controversy, here\\'s an at-a-glance look at the history and current context:  Sikhism is one of the world\\'s major religions, founded in the 16th Century in the Punjab region of what is now India and Pakistan -  which was divided between the two countries after the end of British rule in 1947.  There are around 25 million Sikhs worldwide, making it the fifth largest faith group.   The vast majority live in India, where they make up around 2% of the country\\'s 1.4bn people. But significant diaspora populations exist as well.  Canada is home to the largest population outside India, with around 780,000 Sikh people - more than 2% of the country\\'s population - while both the US and UK are home to around 500,000 and Australia around 200,000.   The Khalistan movement calls for an independent homeland for Sikhs in India.   The movement was at its peak in the 1980s in the Indian state of Punjab, when the area experienced a series of violent attacks and thousands of deaths.  It lost steam after Indian armed forces ran special operations against the movement.   Politics in modern Punjab have shifted away from the movement and calls for independence are not a majority position, according to Prof Shruti Kapila from the University of Cambridge.  But supporters in the Sikh diaspora have continued to advocate for a separate state, with calls for independence intensifying in recent years.  India has strongly opposed the Khalistan movement. All mainstream political parties, including in Punjab, have denounced violence and separatism.  The long-running tensions were the cause of two of the most controversial incidents in modern Indian history - the storming of the Golden Temple and the assassination of Indira Gandhi.   In June 1984, the Indian military stormed the holiest site for Sikhs and flushed out militant separatists sheltering in the temple complex in the city of Amritsar.  The assault, which resulted in many deaths and significant damage to the Golden Temple, had been ordered by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.   A few months after the operation, Gandhi was killed by two of her Sikh bodyguards, which led to four days of rioting and communal violence.   Thousands of people were killed, most of whom were Sikhs. Estimates range from around 3,000 dead to as many as 17,000.   Khalistan is a red line for India because the scars of the violence in the 1980s are still fresh.   All political parties in India are united in their opposition to Sikh independence, so no Indian government can afford to overlook the Khalistan issue in the interest of bilateral diplomatic relations.  Hardeep Singh Nijjar was a Canadian citizen shot dead outside a Sikh temple on 18 June in Canada, at the age of 45.  He was born in Bharsinghpur village in Punjab\\'s Jalandhar, and moved to Canada in 1997.  First he worked as a plumber, and later became a prominent Sikh leader in the western Canadian province of British Columbia.  India designated him a terrorist in 2020, for his alleged links to Khalistan Tiger Force - a group campaigning for independent Khalistan in the Punjab region of India.  His supporters called these accusations \"unfounded\" and said that he had been the target of threats in the past because of his activism.  Reports in the Indian media say he was working on organising an unofficial referendum in India for an independent Sikh state at the time of his death.  Mr Nijjar is the third prominent Sikh figure to have died unexpectedly in recent months.  The backdrop to the diplomatic tensions is the growing pressure India has put on governments of three countries with sizeable Sikh populations: Canada, Australia and the UK.  India\\'s government has openly said that a failure to tackle what it calls \"Sikh extremism\" would be an obstacle to good relations.  Australian officials said they would look into vandalism of Hindu temples by pro-Khalistan activists, but would not stop Australian Sikhs expressing their views on an independent homeland.  Canada has come in for Delhi\\'s most open criticism for  what it sees as a failure to oppose the pro-Khalistan movement there. While PM Justin Trudeau has said he will stop the ongoing violence, he has also pushed back against \"foreign interference\".  In the UK context, a row kicked off in March after protests outside the Indian High Commission in London, which saw crowds wave yellow \"Khalistan\" banners and a man detach the Indian flag from the first-floor balcony of the building.

James Landale  Diplomatic correspondent  UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has said Britain will “listen very, very carefully to the serious concerns that have been raised by Canada” about the killing of a Sikh separatist leader in British Columbia.  He told the BBC he had spoken to the Canadian foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, about the allegations on Monday.  He refused to say if Britain would suspend trade talks with India, but said the UK would wait until the Canadian investigation was complete before deciding what further action to take.  “Both Canada and India are close friends of the UK, they\\'re Commonwealth partners, we take very seriously the things that Canada are saying,\" he said.   \"Obviously, with something as sensitive as this, we want to make sure that Canada is able to conduct a full and transparent investigation. I think it\\'s very important we don\\'t speculate. I\\'m not going to comment until we have more details.”   At a news conference this afternoon, Mukhbir Singh of the Canada-based World Sikh Organisation (WSO) said Justin Trudeau\\'s allegations \"may have shocked many Canadians, but it was not a surprise to the Sikh community\".  \"For decades, India has targeted Sikhs in Canada with espionage, disinformation and now murder,\" Singh said.   The WSO has been vocal about their support for Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who openly advocated for the creation of Khalistan - a separate homeland for Sikhs.   Singh said Nijjar had spoken for months about threats to his safety, and that Canadian intelligence was aware of this.  Singh added India\\'s actions should be condemned by the international community.  He outlined several questions for the Canadian government to answer, including identifying and prosecuting those who were involved in Nijjar\\'s death.   The WSO has also asked Canada for immediate protection of those Sikhs deemed to be at risk in the country.  Michael Kugelman - director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, a think tank based in Washington - says there are a number of reasons why the Canadian government did not feel the need to be discreet about the row with India.  \"It’s already so upset with Delhi, and it simply was not feeling sufficiently concerned about the risks of going public.   \"The second factor, I think, is that Canada takes this very seriously.\"  Kugelman says Justin Trudeau\\'s remarks on the attack of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil \"conveys a sense of just how major an issue this is\" and he decided to go public.  Kugelman adds the impact \"should not be overstated\".  \"For India, this is a government that’s trying to build up broader ties with the West for reasons of trade, but also for strategic reasons. And for Canada, certainly India is perceived as being a key strategic partner, a big part of the Indo-Pacific vision that Canada shares.\"  At a news conference a few minutes ago, Canada\\'s Conservative opposition leader Pierre Poilievre called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to release more information on what he knows about India\\'s alleged involvement with Hardeep Singh Nijjar\\'s death.   \"The prime minister needs to come clean with all the facts,\" Poilievre says. \"We need to know all the evidence possible so that Canadians can make judgements on that.\"  Asked whether Canada needed to change its relationship with India, Poilievre reiterated he needed to know more before making a judgement.  \"He [Trudeau] didn\\'t tell me any more in private than he told Canadians in public.\"  Yogita Limaye  Mumbai correspondent  Less than\\n10 days ago, at the G20 summit held in Delhi, India, the extent to which ties between\\nIndia and Canada were strained was evident.   While Indian Prime Minister Narendra\\nModi and his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau shook hands and smiled at each\\nother, the encounter was brief in comparison with Modi’s photo ops with\\nother leaders. Trudeau also skipped the Indian president’s dinner for G20\\nleaders.  Five years\\nago when Trudeau came to India with his family, it was a very different\\npicture, full of warmth and camaraderie.  The relationship began to sour when Trudeau\\nexpressed concerns over anti-government farmer protests in India in 2020, seen\\nby some as aimed at appeasing the Sikh diaspora, many of whose\\nfamilies were a part of the demonstrations.  And over\\nthe past couple of years, the friction has deepened as numerous protests and\\nevents have been held in Canada demanding the establishment of \"Khalistan\", a separate Sikh homeland\\nin India’s Punjab state.  India\\naccuses Canada of providing shelter to \"Khalistani\" separatists and says Prime\\nMinister Trudeau’s latest allegation is an attempt to shift focus from\\nCanada’s inaction over Delhi’s long-standing concerns.  The killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar\\'s sparked protests outside the Indian consulate in Vancouver in June this year.   His funeral a day later was held in Surrey, British Columbia, and was attended by thousands of people - many of whom waved Khalistan flags.   A spokesperson from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police\\'s homicide team says that their inquiry into the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar is a \"priority investigation\".   In an statement to the BBC, the Integrated Homicide Investigative Team (IHIT) spokesperson says that they will \"continue to work closely with our local, provincial and national police agencies and partners in order to advance this investigation\".   They added they could not discuss anything more specific at the moment, and urged anyone with information to contact the IHIT.   In case you\\'re just joining us or would like a refresh, here is what has been happening today.   US officials have urged India to co-operate with an investigation into allegations the Indian government was involved in the killing of a Sikh separatist leader.   The US has been in close contact with Canada over the accusation, a senior state department official said.   \"We\\'re quite concerned about the allegations. We think it\\'s important there is a full and open investigation and we would urge the Indian government to co-operate with that investigation,\" the official added.   More now from Trudeau.   He says the Indian government needs to \"take this matter with the\\nutmost seriousness\".   \"We are doing that, we are not looking to\\nprovoke or escalate,\" he told reporters.  We\\'re now getting some more comments from Canada\\'s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.   Trudeau says the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada is \"extremely serious\".   We\\'ll bring you more from Trudeau as we get it.   Sachin Gogoi  BBC Monitoring  Indian media love to hate the Canadian prime minister.  During a recent visit to Delhi in India for the G20 Summit, media coverage of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was harsh - to put it mildly.  Media criticised and lampooned Trudeau for a host of reasons - from his tense meeting with Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to a technical snag in his aircraft that forced him to extend his stay in the Indian capital by 36 hours.  There seems to be a general agreement in India’s news media that Trudeau has been responsible for a downslide in India-Canada ties because of his alleged support for the Sikh separatists.  India and Canada’s expulsions of each other’s diplomats following Trudeau’s allegation of India’s “potential” involvement in the killing of a prominent Sikh separatist figure has only resulted in more criticism.  A report by leading Hindi news channel Aaj Tak said Trudeau’s allegation was not surprising “given he is in power with support from Khalistan supporters”.   Similarly, a report on the website of the prominent Hindustan Times daily said Trudeau’s comments would “ further damage bilateral relations which are already at an all-time low”.  Zoya Mateen  Reporting from Delhi  Security has been stepped up outside the Canadian high commission in Delhi.  Earlier today, the Indian government expelled a senior Canadian diplomat and gave him five days to leave the country after Canada expelled Indian diplomat Pavan Kumar Rai over the case.  Since then, authorities have deployed several police officers and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) outside the commission building, which is located in the heart of the capital city.  All has been quiet so far – and there have been no reports of protests breaking out in and around the complex, but authorities do not want to take chances and have tightened security to prevent any incidents.  Read more about the reaction in India here.  Ashitha Nagesh  BBC News Community Affairs Correspondent  A little bit more now about the death of Sikh separatist activist Avtar Singh Khanda, who died on 15 June in Birmingham, West Midlands, following a sudden illness.  In the UK, some groups are repeating calls for an investigation into his death.  He was said to be the head of the Khalistan Liberation Force, which the Indian government has proscribed as a terrorist organisation.  Some British-Sikh supporters of the Khalistan movement are saying that, in light of the allegations from the Canadian government around the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, UK authorities should look into Khanda\\'s death as well.   As I mentioned earlier, West Midlands Police at the time said there were no suspicious circumstances in Khanda\\'s death, and confirmed to me again today they would not be opening an investigation.  The campaign for a separate Sikh state, known as Khalistan, is a highly contentious issue within the Sikh community in the UK.   Like Canada and the UK, Australia has a sizeable Sikh population and has now reacted to Trudeau\\'s allegations of there being \"credible intelligence\" of a possible link between the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and the Indian state.  A spokesperson for Australia\\'s Foreign Minister, Penny Wong, says that Australia is \"deeply concerned\" by the allegations \"and notes the ongoing investigations into this matter\".  \"We are closely engaged with partners on developments. We have conveyed our concerns at senior levels to India,\" the spokesperson says.   Aleem Maqbool  Religion editor  In Britain, Sikh organisations have expressed outrage that even after a UN working group called for the immediate release of Jagtar Johal, a pro-Khalistan and Sikh rights activist from Dumbarton, the UK government has failed to ask that he be set free.  Johal has been held in an Indian prison for more than six years without trial, accused of extremist activities, but says he has been tortured and forced to sign a confession. Human rights group Reprieve says it has evidence that his arrest came (while he was in India to get married) after a tip-off from British intelligence agencies.  Last month, the British government announced new funding to respond to “pro-Khalistan extremism”. Even prominent British Sikhs opposed to the Khalistan movement, who may have faced intimidation because of their stance, say there is little evidence that the activism among Sikhs in the UK strays into what constitutes “extremism”.  They have warned that the Indian government’s focus on suppressing Khalistan support has been counterproductive, and is leading young Sikhs in an otherwise peaceful community, to explore a movement that had been on the decline.  Britain will continue trade negotiations with India despite \"serious allegations\" that the Indian government may be linked to Hardeep Singh Nijjar\\'s murder, No 10 said.   The UK government is in \"close touch\" with its Canadian partners about the allegations, the prime minister\\'s official spokesman said.   \"It\\'s right that the Canadian authorities are looking into them, but I\\'m not going to get ahead of that work that needs to take place now,\" he added.  The spokesman said that work on trade negotiations would \"continue as before\", adding that the government was \"not looking to conflate\" trade negotiations with \"other issues\".     Memories of the decade-long armed Sikh insurgency, which peaked in the 1980s, remain strong.              ',\n",
       " 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66805584': 'They strolled side by side through the gleaming space centre - stopping to peer into the pit from where rockets blast into space.  At their lavish banquet, they drank Russian wines and toasted the embrace of their two pariah states.  And before leaving, they swapped guns as gifts - model rifles from each others\\' munitions lines.  The optics of Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin\\'s date in eastern Russia clearly underscore a relationship that is being strengthened in wartime.  It isn\\'t over yet, with the North Korean leader spending several days touring shipyards, aircraft factories and other military sites before he returns home.  There had been great anticipation in the lead-up - with global media rapt as Kim trundled for hours in his armoured train over the border.  He kept the West guessing for nearly 40 hours before reaching the Vostochny Cosmodrome - a space base in a far-flung eastern corner of Russia. Even then, it was unclear what exactly the pair would be meeting to talk about - with White House warnings last week that the North could sell arms to Russia sparking alarm.  Putin had sent ahead a welcome party to greet Kim as his train rolled onto the space base\\'s tracks. A red-carpeted, balustrade staircase was also erected mid-air, waiting for the train to pull in and for the North Korean leader to step out.  Putin was waiting in front of the centre when Kim drew up in his limousine. There, before flashing cameras, the two leaders shook hands - the pictures beamed out immediately by state media.  Both leaders know the power of showmanship, but the Supreme Leader of North Korea, as Kim is known, is particularly a fan of ceremony. He is third in a dynasty of supreme leaders \"who have generations of mythology constructed around them\", says Sarah Son, a North Korea expert at the University of Sheffield.  \"It wouldn\\'t do to be seen as a run-of-the-mill, limited term state leader by domestic audiences, who will be seeing this journey and parts of the meetings on television and in the newspaper.  \"It\\'s very important for Kim to have one-to-one meetings with leaders of other countries so that all eyes are on him, making North Korea appear as a more significant global player than it actually is.  \"Sanctions of course remain extremely tight and Russia\\'s need for arms presents an opportunity to achieve two complementary aims: income for the North Korean state and evidence that Kim is worthy of the attention of the leader of a major global power.\"  About an hour before the two leaders met, Pyongyang had also fired off two ballistic missiles - the first launched without the leader at home.  \"The summit defiantly linked pariah state behaviour in Europe and Asia,\" says Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.  But beyond the spectacle and bombast, observers question whether the meeting achieved any concrete deals. Little was revealed publicly.   \"As of now, it appears that there have been no substantial developments in the public domain,\" says Fyodor Tertitskiy, a North Korean military researcher at Kookmin University in Seoul.  \"We observed a two-fold event - a grand spectacle primarily designed for foreign audiences and undisclosed agreements behind closed doors, the significance of which remains uncertain.\"  No detail was revealed of the feared arms deal the West is concerned could boost Russia\\'s fight in Ukraine.  And no word was mentioned either of certain gains for North Korea - of food aid, economic help or military and technology sharing, the things that Kim would have wanted say analysts.  Instead the only known advance appears to be Putin hinting he could potentially help with Kim\\'s space and satellite goals.   That\\'s where the choice of venue was noticeable analysts say. Both leaders travelled long distances to get to the space port on the other side of the country from Moscow.  But meeting at the site provided significant optics for Putin, analysts say.  First, his offer of space assistance could be argued as being within the acceptable limits of what Russia can give North Korea.  Pyongyang has failed twice this year to get a spy satellite into space - their technology is still decades behind Russia\\'s.  And for Moscow, helping put a satellite in space so the North can watch its enemies is vastly different to the Kremlin aiding a nuclear and missiles programme banned by the UN Security Council.  But the problem remains that we don\\'t know what was actually promised to the North.  Pyongyang has nuclear warhead-topped intercontinental ballistic missiles which in theory could reach the US. They currently don\\'t-  because the North in part hasn\\'t worked out how to keep them from frying as they fly through space.  Russia and the US however know how to protect their missiles- from the same technology they use to protect their satellites. If Moscow has shared this technology with Pyongyang, the US could potentially be in striking distance.  As such, the meeting this week at the spaceport is \"equivalent to Putin thumbing his nose at UN Security Council Resolutions\", says Prof Easley.   \"This should be a wake-up call to all other UN member states about the need to redouble efforts at enforcing sanctions on Pyongyang,\" he said.  But there remains significant doubt over whether Russia would share any of its space jewels, or even sees the North\\'s arms as anything more than a back-up supply.  \"Even with regards to the satellite technology, Putin\\'s statements were cautious, not an explicit commitment to provide assistance but rather a strong implication that it may be considered,\" says Mr Tertitskiy.  He also points out the near non-existent money flows between the two - despite the rhetoric surrounding weapons, trade remains near zero according to South Korean estimates. North Korea remains reliant on China for over 95% of its trade income.  \"This leaves us uncertain whether this summit will yield any more concrete results than the fruitless 2019 meeting did,\" he says, referring to the last time the two leaders met.  It has been four years since that huddle, and for Kim this rare trip shouldn\\'t be underplayed, analysts say. This was his first foray abroad in four years, as his reclusive state also begins to re-open to the world post pandemic.  Putin made sure that he would be treated handsomely, observers say.  The meeting could have just been held in Vladivostok, on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum, Putin\\'s signature Asia-facing platform which has previously been attended by Chinese and South Korean leaders.  Instead, he chose to give Kim centre stage, at a different venue altogether - bringing out the red carpet, the banquet, the brass marching band - and then also making the trip to meet him there.  \"It is a sign of respect for Kim. This could be seen as a gesture to ensure Kim feels valued,\" says Mr Tertitskiy.  But equally, he says, it\\'s also about the message being sent to the West - elevating the perception of their relationship even when the details are scant.  But in this relationship, it\\'s crucial to focus on what the two sides actually do, he says.  \"Both Kim and Putin are adept at employing deception. Once again, it\\'s imperative to scrutinise their concrete actions rather than their words.\"  As it happened: Kim and Putin\\'s meeting at Russia\\'s space dome  Kim Jong Un extends Russia visit by several days  The US wants to talk to North Korea but doesn\\'t know how  Kim and Putin discuss possible military cooperation  Putin and Kim: Friends in need (of ammunition)  Torture, rape, killings: An Indian state\\'s brutal conflict  UK\\'s Sunak moves to weaken green policies  Ceasefire deal as Karabakh forces agree to disarm  Torture, rape, killings: An Indian state\\'s brutal conflict  How India-Canada ties descended into a public feud  Explained: Conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh  A haunted Australia stares down bushfire disaster again  Musk\\'s influence grows as world leaders flock to him  \\'I was in Iran\\'s police - then joined protesters\\'  Ghanaian man who fought slavery celebrated in the UK  Forget LA â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s British film studios that are in demand  Russia superyacht symbolises challenge of seizing assets  The \\'most British of French resorts\\'  How expensive is Burning Man?

       " 'https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66862576': \"China's imports of seafood from Japan slumped last month as Tokyo started to release treated waste water from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant.  Imports of Japanese seafood fell 67.6% in August from the same month last year, China's customs authority said.  Japan's ministry of agriculture and fisheries says China was the world's top importer of the country's seafood.  Last year, Asia's largest economy imported 84.4 billion yen ($571m; Â£461m) of seafood from its neighbour.  The sharp fall came as Japan prepared to start releasing the waste water and in the aftermath of the release.  Since the 2011 tsunami which severely damaged the Fukushima nuclear plant, more than a million tonnes of treated waste water has accumulated there.   Japan began discharging it on 24 August, in a process that will take 30 years to complete. The same day China said it would ban all Japanese seafood imports.  Fishing industry groups in Japan and the wider region also expressed concerns at the time about the impact of the release on their livelihoods.  The Chinese import ban came despite Japan saying the water was safe, and many scientists agreeing. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog also approved the plan.  Tokyo has also stressed that similar releases of waste water are common from other nuclear power plants in China and France.  Japan makes regular reports to show that the seawater near Fukushima is showing no detectable levels of radioactivity.  China strongly protested the release, while disinformation prompted incidents such as rocks being thrown at Japanese schools in China and reports of hundreds of hostile phone calls to local businesses in Fukushima.  Tokyo has also warned its citizens visiting China to take precautions and avoid speaking Japanese loudly in public.  The Japanese government has promised financial help for the fishing industry, while the company running the Fukushima plant, Tepco, said it was prepared to compensate local businesses affected by the release.  The country's politicians have also been promoting the safety of Fukushima seafood and water.  In a video released by the Japanese government, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida ate sashimi from Fukushima while former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi surfed in the area.  Economists have said that the fall in seafood exports is unlikely to have a major impact on Japan's overall economy as its total exports to China are dominated by cars and machinery.

       " 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66851144': 'The escalating row over the murder of a Sikh separatist leader has the potential to derail years of close relations between Canada and India, two key strategic partners on security and trade.  The rift burst into the open on Monday when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada was investigating \"credible allegations\" about the potential involvement of Indian government agents in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia in June.   India responded furiously - it \"completely rejected\" the allegations, calling them \"absurd\". Both have expelled one of the other\\'s diplomats and it\\'s unclear how they now pull back from the brink.  Just a few months ago, the countries were making progress towards signing a free trade agreement - long in the works - this year. Now, talks are paused and an imminent Canadian trade mission to India postponed.  So how did things reach this point?  The recent G20 summit hosted by Delhi offered some hints, key among them Mr Trudeau\\'s tense (and short) meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Then he suffered the embarrassment of having to wait in Delhi for two more days before he could leave after his plane developed a technical fault.  After the two leaders met there was no mincing of words. Mr Trudeau said Canada would always defend \"freedom of expression\" while acting against hatred.   In an uncharacteristically sharp statement, the Indian government said it had \"strong concerns about continuing anti-India activities of extremist elements in Canada\" who it accused of \"promoting secessionism and inciting violence against Indian diplomats\".  The reference is to calls by Sikh activists in Canada for Khalistan, or a separate homeland for Sikhs. It\\'s a demand that evokes painful memories for millions in India, especially in northern Punjab state where Sikhs form the majority of the population (outside Punjab, Canada has the highest number of Sikhs in the world).   The demand for Khalistan peaked in India in the 1980s with an armed insurgency later crushed - thousands of people were killed. The movement is not prominent in Punjab now, and all mainstream Indian political parties vocally oppose it.   But calls for Khalistan are still loud among some in the Sikh diaspora in countries such as Canada, Australia and the UK. Delhi has reacted sharply to demonstrations for and referendums on Khalistan by Sikh activists in these countries - not illegal there, but a major irritant for India.  The issue received wider global attention after three pro-Khalistan activists died in quick succession in different countries earlier this year.   Paramjit Singh Panjwar, chief of the Khalistan Commando Force who was designated a terrorist by India, was shot dead in May in Pakistan - his killers haven\\'t been identified yet.   In the UK, Avtar Singh Khanda, said to be the head of the Khalistan Liberation Force, died on 15 June in hospital. Khanda had been arrested in March after a demonstration in London where protesters pulled down the Indian flag at the country\\'s embassy. But a UK police spokesperson said the death \"was not deemed to be suspicious\".  Three days after his death, Nijjar, also designated a terrorist by India, was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in British Columbia - it\\'s this murder that has now led Canada to take a strong public stand against a powerful ally.  Relations between the two have survived previous strains - Canada reacted sharply to Indian nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998; India expressed its disappointment in 2005 after two Canadian Sikhs accused of a deadly Air India bombing were acquitted.  But otherwise, the two nations have mostly been on good terms, except for the Khalistan issue. They have a lot in common: \"a shared tradition of democracy and pluralism\" and \"a common commitment to a rules-based international system\", as Canada itself puts it.   They are both Commonwealth countries and members of the G20 group of leading world economies. Canada, which wants a bigger footprint in Asia, sees India as a counterweight to China.   It\\'s not just geopolitics, the countries also have strong trade links.  India was Canada\\'s 10th largest trading partner in 2022, with bilateral trade in goods at $11.9bn that year, up 56% from the previous year. They were very close to signing that trade agreement now on the backburner.  So there\\'s obviously a lot at stake for both countries.   \"I do think that this is a lesson to us all that there is nothing sacrosanct about India\\'s close relationships with Western partners. This is a wake-up call that yes, India is a non-aligned player, it values its relations with the Global South, it definitely values its relations with the West. But that doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s going to be insulated from the possibility of a major crisis in relations,\" says Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center think-tank in Washington.  India\\'s foreign minister S Jaishankar said earlier this year that Canada\\'s response to Khalistan has been driven by \"vote bank compulsion\", a reference to the support Mr Trudeau\\'s Liberal Party gets from Sikhs. Mr Trudeau\\'s minority government is also backed by the New Democratic Party (NDP), which is led by Jagmeet Singh, himself a Sikh.  It\\'s an assessment many Indian experts agree with.  Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga Institute of Indo-Pacific Studies, says that Mr Trudeau\\'s statements on the issue of Khalistan are \"divisive\".   \"He ignores the sentiments of the larger Indo-Canadian community, which includes the Canadian Sikhs, and appears biased in favour of the Khalistanis. Would he like external support for Quebec separatists? Of course not,\" he says, adding that the relationship between India and Canada has become more stressful due to Mr Trudeau.  \"In the name of democracy, human rights and freedom of speech, Canada should not jeopardise its relations with other countries.\"  But Avinash Paliwal, who teaches politics and international studies at SOAS University of London, says the sudden escalation may not be due to just domestic compulsions.  \"If your intelligence agencies have gathered credible information that another country, even if it is an ally, was involved in a covert operation on your soil, you\\'re bound to act on that,\" he says, adding that it\\'s likely that Mr Trudeau tried to raise the issue through other channels first.  According to India\\'s statement, Mr Trudeau did bring up the allegation with Mr Modi but received short shrift.   The Canadian PM has received support from other domestic politicians, including main opposition leader Pierre Poilievre. The West has reacted too - the US says it is \"deeply concerned\" by the allegations, while the UK says it is \"in close touch\" with Canada on the issue.  This video can not be played  Trudeau: We are not looking to \\'provoke\\' India  Experts say that while Western countries see India as necessary to counter China\\'s influence, there is also growing concern about the direction of Indian politics under Mr Modi - critics say attacks on minorities have risen since his government came to power, and raise other human rights concerns.   The developments will also be closely watched by Beijing and Moscow, which will be glad to see a \"fissure between India and the West\", Mr Paliwal says. However, he adds that this wouldn\\'t \"derail the strategic story\" or \"make Washington turn its back\" on India.  Mr Kugelman says China and Russia will see the confrontation differently.   \"Beijing does not want to see India broaden and deepen relations with like-minded countries keen to push back against China. So in that regard, this may be seen as a strategic benefit for Beijing. Russia may be perfectly happy to see Canada bogged down in this crisis,\" he says.  In the short term, though, an India-Canada confrontation will have geopolitical consequences. If Canada continues to issue strong statements and goes on to directly accuse India, it will present a unique challenge to Western governments, specially the UK and Australia.   The way the West backed Delhi at the recent G20 summit was a clear indication that it wants India to be a viable counterweight to China.  But it will be a strategic headache for them if it comes to a point where they have to choose between India and Canada. So far, the UK, the US and Australia have given calculated statements.   But can India and Canada still mend their differences to avoid a geopolitical challenge for the West?  Mr Mahapatra says that while the Khalistan issue can affect economic co-operation in the short term, it\\'s unlikely to derail long-term ties between the countries. He also cautions against \"extreme steps\", especially from Canada.  \"Expelling a diplomat means you don\\'t want a dialogue. Such issues need to be dealt through dialogue and diplomacy, not confrontation,\" he says.

       " 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66856568': 'Western ministers and officials will be working hard to try to ensure the diplomatic row between Canada and India does not bleed into other international relationships.   The last thing the United States and other western powers want now is a row that divides them from India.   On the grand geopolitical chess board, India is a key player.   Not only is it a growing power - the most populous country in the world, the fifth-biggest economy. But it is also seen by the West as a potential bulwark against China.   This was apparent at the recent G20 meeting in India when Ukraine\\'s Western allies agreed a final communique which did not condemn Russia by name for its invasion.   They chose to protect their relationship with India by avoiding a row over the statement, a choice which angered some in Kyiv.  The other fear among Western diplomats will be the risk that countries start taking sides in the Canada-India dispute.  Tensions between the two nations deepened considerably this week when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of being behind the assassination of a Sikh activist in western Canada in June.   In recent months India has been trying to pitch itself as the leader of developing countries - sometimes called the Global South. Many of these countries have refused to condemn Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine.   The US and some European countries have been making real diplomatic efforts to win over these countries, telling them the war matters to them and their economy.   Diplomats will not want this row to upset those efforts if it is somehow spun as a North v South battle between two Commonwealth countries, a confrontation between a transatlantic power and a developing nation.  Canada\\'s foreign ministry said Mr Trudeau had raised the issue with US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.  For now Canada\\'s allies are staying loyal but cautious.   The White House said the US was \"deeply concerned\" about the allegations of the murder, saying it was \"critical that Canada\\'s investigation proceed and the perpetrators be brought to justice\".  For countries like the UK and Australia, which both have large Sikh communities, there is always the potential for a diplomatic row like this to have domestic political consequences.  UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said Britain would \"listen very, very carefully to the serious concerns that have been raised by Canada\".   He told the BBC he had spoken to Canadian Foreign Minister MÃ©lanie Joly about the allegations on Monday, and the UK took \"very seriously the things that Canada are saying\".  He refused to say if Britain would suspend trade talks with India - but said the UK would wait until the Canadian investigation was complete before deciding what further action to take.  \"Both Canada and India are close friends of the UK, they\\'re Commonwealth partners,\" Mr Cleverly said.   A spokesperson for Australia\\'s foreign ministry said Canberra was \"deeply concerned\\' by the allegations, and had \"conveyed our concerns at senior levels in India\".  So for now, the West will wait and watch as the investigation progresses.   Some allies may be given access to what Canadian intelligence knows. What would change the situation is if firm proof was established.   If that happened, Western powers would have to make a choice between backing Ottawa or New Delhi, a choice between supporting the principle of the rule of law or the hard necessity of realpolitik.  In the past, Western nations have condemned alleged extraterritorial assassinations carried out by countries such as Russia or Iran or Saudi Arabia.   They will not want India to join that list.

The contentious bill, first proposed in 1996, has been pending for decades amid opposition from some political parties.  Its revival is expected to boost the governing Bharatiya Janata Party\\'s fortunes in general elections next May.  The bill was tabled at the new Indian parliament\\'s first session and is still some way from becoming law.  It would require the approval of both houses of parliament and a majority of state legislatures, as well as the Indian president\\'s signature.  Reported plans to increase the overall  number of constituencies could further complicate its implementation.  In his opening speech at the new parliament building, Mr Modi praised the proposed legislation and said it was a special moment for the country.   \"The world understands that only talking of women-led development is not enough. This is a positive step taken on that front,\" he told politicians as he appealed to them to support the bill.  The PM also took a swipe at the opposition and said that the previous Congress party-led governments had failed to clear the bill when they were in power.    \"There have been discussions around women\\'s reservations for years. We can say with pride that we have scripted history,\" he said.   Mr Modi inaugurated the new parliament building in May but no business was held there until now.  He called a five-day special session which began on Monday but the first day\\'s sitting was held in the old parliament building.  On Tuesday morning, members from both houses assembled for a photo session at the old building, followed by an event commemorating parliament\\'s legacy in the Central Hall of the British-era building.  They then moved to the new parliament as the office of the lower house of parliament officially designated it as the Parliament House of India.   The proceedings are being held amid criticism from opposition leaders who claim that the government has not disclosed all the business that could come up during the week.  According to the government, eight bills have been listed for discussion during the session - but this agenda could be changed or expanded during the course of the week.  The new parliament building is part of the government\\'s ambitious Central Vista project in Delhi to replace colonial-era government buildings.  Built in front of the old parliament, the new four-storey building - constructed at an estimated cost of 9.7bn rupees ($117m; Â£94m) - is much bigger and has the capacity to seat 1,272 MPs.  The Lok Sabha chamber, which will seat the lower house of the parliament, is designed in the likeness of a peacock, India\\'s national bird. The Rajya Sabha chamber, which will seat the upper house, is designed to resemble the lotus - India\\'s national flower and also Mr Modi\\'s Bharatiya Janata Party\\'s election symbol.  The current parliament building will be converted into a museum.  BBC News India is now on YouTube. Click here to subscribe and watch our documentaries, explainers and features.

       " 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66805344': 'Indian lawmakers, including PM Narendra Modi, have paid tribute to the country\\'s old parliament ahead of a move to a new building.  The MPs were speaking on the first day of a week-long special parliament session called by the government.  Mr Modi had inaugurated the new parliament building in May but no business was held there till now.  On Tuesday, the session will shift to the new building after an event to celebrate the old parliament\\'s legacy.  The special session is being held amid criticism from opposition leaders who claim that the government has not disclosed all the business that could come up during the week.   According to the government, eight bills have been listed for discussion during the session - but this agenda could be changed or expanded during the course of the week.  Opposition leaders have questioned whether a special session was necessary to discuss these bills when MPs are set to meet later this year for the winter session of parliament.  Indian lawmakers usually meet for regular business three times a year in parliament - a budget session, a monsoon session and a winter session.   On Monday, Mr Modi began the special session by commemorating the legacy of India\\'s parliament since 1947, when the country became independent from British rule. The government has held several events to mark the 75th anniversary of India\\'s independence.   Mr Modi said that leaving the old parliament was an \"emotional moment\" as the building was filled with special memories and that the structure would continue to inspire future generations.  \"The biggest achievement of this parliament is that it has kept people\\'s faith in democracy alive,\" he said in a speech where he also mentioned India\\'s successful Moon landing and hosting of the G20 summit.  Some opposition leaders shared their memories of the old parliament while also taking pot-shots at Mr Modi\\'s government, accusing it of not answering questions and targeting political rivals.  Ahead of the special session, Mr Modi had said that its duration may be \"short\" but that it would include \"historic decisions\".  Special sessions are not that common - according to legislative expert Chakshu Roy, the government has sometimes convened them \"for specific occasions, like commemorating parliamentary or national milestones\".  The announcement of the session last month had sparked criticism from opposition leaders, who questioned the government\\'s \"secrecy\" over the agenda. It also sparked intense speculation, with some commentators saying that the government might call early elections or even change the country\\'s name from India to Bharat (after a controversy erupted over a possible name change).  Others have said that the government may bring in a historic bill that will reserve seats for women in state legislatures and parliament - on Monday, some opposition lawmakers protested outside parliament, asking for this bill to be introduced.  But the government has not confirmed any of this yet.   Last week, after weeks of criticism from the opposition, it released a \"tentative agenda\" for the session which listed four bills for debate, including a controversial one that will change how India\\'s chief election commissioner is appointed.  Opposition parties have objected to the bill, calling it \"undemocratic\" and saying that it will reduce the independence of the Election Commission and its officers. However, this bill was not in the list of items that the government gave to opposition leaders at an all-party meeting on Sunday.  BBC News India is now on YouTube.

       " 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66840138': 'China\\'s top diplomat Wang Yi is visiting Russia as it seeks continued support for its war on Ukraine.  Any bid to end the war must take into account Moscow\\'s interests, Mr Wang and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov were quoted as saying after a meeting.  A close ally of Moscow, Beijing is accused of supporting Russia indirectly during the war, which it denies.  Russian media said Mr Wang\\'s trip would also pave the way for President Vladimir Putin\\'s visit to China soon.  This comes after Mr Putin met North Korea\\'s Kim Jong Un amid US fears they could strike an arms deal.  China\\'s foreign ministry said Mr Wang is in Russia for four days for \"strategic security consultations\".  After Monday\\'s talks, the Russian foreign ministry said he and Mr Lavrov discussed the Ukraine war \"and noted the futility of attempts to settle the crisis without taking account of Russia\\'s interests and, more particularly, its participation\".  China has put out its own Ukraine peace plan, unveiled during a whirlwind of diplomacy undertaken by Mr Wang earlier this year when he last visited Moscow and met Mr Putin.  While China is keen on seeing an end to the Ukraine war so it can repair its relations with Europe, it also wants to \"separate that outcome from determining who is to blame for the war\", since it is sympathetic to Russia, noted Rorry Daniels, managing director of the Asia Society Policy Institute.  China has been accused by the US of aiding Russia economically and supplying key technology since the war began.   A US intelligence report released in July said Beijing is \"pursuing a variety of economic support mechanisms for Russia that mitigate both the impact of Western sanctions and export controls\".   It cited China\\'s increased purchases of Russian energy exports, the increased use of its currency in transactions with Russia, and the \"probable\" supply of dual technology - items which could be deployed for both civilian and military purposes such as drones - for use in Ukraine.  China has consistently denied such allegations and insists it maintains an objective position on the war.   Earlier this month Mr Putin said he expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, but did not say when.   Some observers believe he is likely to attend the Belt and Road Forum next month.  He has not travelled abroad since the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him in March over war crimes in Ukraine. Mr Putin last ventured onto foreign soil in December 2022 when he visited Belarus and Kyrgyzstan.  \"Inviting Putin to China is a way to show support for Russia but that support must also be framed as a legitimate attempt to get Russia to the negotiating table so that China doesn\\'t worsen its position with the Europeans,\" said Ms Daniels.  Mr Wang\\'s visit comes as Mr Kim wrapped up his highly controversial visit to Russia.  On Monday he was heading home with presents including a Russian-made rifle, a cosmonaut\\'s glove, a bulletproof vest, a fur hat and military drones, according to Russian media.  The US alleged Mr Kim\\'s visit was to discuss the selling of North Korean arms to Russia. Moscow is thought to be facing a shortage of weapons and ammunition.  Russia and North Korea have said they talked about \"military co-operation\" and aid for Pyongyang\\'s satellite programme.  When asked about Mr Kim\\'s trip last week, China\\'s foreign ministry declined to comment saying it was \"something between their two countries\".   But some analysts believe that any mutual North Korea-Russia support is happening with China\\'s knowledge or even implicit consent, given Beijing\\'s close ties with the other two countries.  Those relationships extend beyond socialist ideology and their shared distrust of the US and the West. Beijing has long been Pyongyang\\'s economic lifeline through trade, and in the past year it has started becoming Moscow\\'s as well through ramped-up purchases of Russian oil and gas.  \"Whatever\\'s happening with Russia and North Korea cannot be happening without China knowing about it... I don\\'t think they would cooperate militarily without Beijing\\'s approval,\" said Alexander Korolev, an expert on China-Russia relations with the University of New South Wales in Australia.  China could even see North Korea as a useful proxy to help Russia in the Ukraine war, he added.   \"Simply by greenlighting North Korea to have military cooperation with Russia is a way to help Russia with very low reputational costs. It could blame North Korea\\'s rogue regime [whose actions have] nothing to do with them. It would be a smart move, if this is the case.\" he said.  Mr Wang\\'s visit to Russia also comes a day after he met US national security adviser Jake Sullivan in Malta. Besides the US-China relationship, the two men had also discussed regional security and the Ukraine war, according to statements put out by the US and China.  While the US may be talking to China to put pressure on North Korea to stop any cooperation, it may be unlikely China would do this, said Dr Korolev.   \"If China wanted to play ball the American way, they had more than a year\" to stop the war but they have not, he said.

       " 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66852841': 'An Indonesian court has sentenced a woman to two years in jail for posting a viral TikTok video where she said an Islamic phrase before eating pork.   Lina Lutfiawati, 33, was found guilty of \"inciting hatred\" against religious individuals and groups.  She also faces a $16,245 (Â£13,155) fine. Her jail term may be extended by three months if she does not pay up.   It is the latest in a series of cases involving controversial blasphemy laws in Muslim-majority Indonesia.   Lina Lutfiawati, who adopted the Indian name Lina Mukherjee due to her love of Bollywood movies, identifies as Muslim. The consumption of pork is strictly forbidden in Islam.   The lifestyle influencer, who has more than two million TikTok followers, also runs a business in India.    In March, she posted a video where she uttered \"Bismillah\" - an Arabic phrase that means \"in the name of God\" - before eating crispy pork skin.   At the time, she was travelling in Bali, a tourist hotspot in Indonesia that, unlike the rest of the country, has a majority Hindu population. Ms Lutfiawati said she tried pork out of curiosity.  The video got millions of views and was widely criticised, prompting another Indonesian to report her to the police for \"knowingly eating pork skin as a Muslim\".  Police charged Ms Lutfiawati in May for disseminating hateful information, saying it was an act of hostility over ethnicity, religion, and race.  Many conservative groups across the country also issued rulings calling the video blasphemous. They included the Ulema Council, Indonesia\\'s top Muslim clerical body.  On Indonesian social media, the reaction to her jailing has so far been divided, with many praising the judge and calling her actions blasphemous. Others have criticised Ms Lutfiawati\\'s jail sentence, noting that the jail terms meted out for corruption cases are often much lower.   Rights groups and activists in Indonesia have long criticised the blasphemy laws, which they say are frequently misused to target religious minorities.  Indonesian police last year arrested six people after a bar promoted free alcohol - prohibited in Islam - for customers named Mohammed.

Footage of the aftermath shows power lines on fire and cars overturned.   Hundreds of people were temporarily relocated because of the tornado, and at least five people are known to have died, state media reported on Tuesday.  Local media also reported weather warnings for heavy rain and strong winds in the region.  China saw has seen both extreme heat and devastating floods this summer.   The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but we know that increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons.   As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall.  Violent tornado sends debris flying in Chinese city.
